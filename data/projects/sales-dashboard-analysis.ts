      This project involved creating a dynamic and interactive sales dashboard using Power BI to help stakeholders visualize and understand complex sales data. 
      The key objective was to consolidate data from multiple sources into a single, cohesive report that could provide actionable insights.
      <br/><br/>
      I built this dashboard end-to-end, covering the entire BI lifecycle from data extraction and transformation using PowerQuery to developing a robust data model and writing complex DAX measures for KPIs like Year-over-Year Growth, Quota Attainment, and Profit Margin. The final dashboard features drill-through capabilities, dynamic filters, and bookmarks to enhance user experience.
