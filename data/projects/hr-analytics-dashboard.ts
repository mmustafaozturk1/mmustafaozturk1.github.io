  fullContent: `
      The HR Analytics Dashboard was designed to give the Human Resources department a clear view of key workforce metrics. 
      By analyzing data from our HRIS, we were able to identify trends in employee attrition, evaluate the effectiveness of our recruitment strategies, and monitor progress towards our diversity and inclusion goals.
      <br/><br/>
      This dashboard includes detailed visualizations on headcount by department, voluntary vs. involuntary turnover rates, average tenure, and a complete recruitment pipeline analysis. It has become an essential tool for strategic workforce planning.
