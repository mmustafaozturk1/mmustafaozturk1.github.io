      In the world of Power BI and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), one of the most common points of confusion for beginners is the difference between Measures and Calculated Columns. Both allow you to enrich your data model, but they work in fundamentally different ways and have significant performance implications.
      <br/><br/>
      <h2>Calculated Columns</h2>
      A calculated column is computed row by row during data refresh and is stored in the xVelocity in-memory database, just like any other column you import. This means it consumes RAM and increases the size of your model.
      <br/>
      <strong>When to use them:</strong> Use calculated columns when you need to see the result in a slicer, on an axis of a chart, or as a filter condition in a tableâ€”essentially, when you want to "stamp" a static value onto each row.
      <br/><br/>
      <h2>Measures</h2>
      A measure is a calculation that is performed at query time, in response to the user's interaction with the report (e.g., applying a filter). Measures are not stored in the model; they are calculated on the fly based on the current filter context.
      <br/>
      <strong>When to use them:</strong> Use measures for aggregations like Sum, Average, Count, or for complex business logic that needs to dynamically respond to user selections. The vast majority of your calculations in Power BI should be measures.
      <br/><br/>
      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      Prioritize measures over calculated columns whenever possible to keep your models lean, fast, and scalable. Use calculated columns sparingly and only when a static, row-level value is absolutely necessary for slicing or dicing your data.
